## Welcome

> We are aviators dedicated to providing aviation apps that are simple to use, making flying more safe, fun and affordable.

Our team produces
[**Avare**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ds.avare&hl=en_US&gl=US),
an [Electronic Flight
Bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_flight_bag) for
[Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system))
devices.

Avare provides GPS active location on all FAA charts, Airport Diagrams
and Approach Plates; along with CS (AF/D), weather & TFRs, Flight
Plans and much more.

{% include phone_images.html %}

-   Internet is only required for installing or updating the free app
	and free FAA resources
-   Ground planning and in-flight operations work offline, even in
	"Airplane Mode" for maximum battery life
-   GPS (internal or external to the Android device) is required for
	location services
