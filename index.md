## Welcome

> We are aviators dedicated to providing aviation apps that are simple to use, making flying more safe, fun and affordable.

We offer several Android apps. All are **_free_**, 
[open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), 
designed for most Android devices, are ad-free, and require no
invasive Permissions. \*_**Note** that our apps are thoroughly tested
and are used routinely on a vast array of devices, so if you should
encounter any problems please contact us on our
[Forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/apps4av-forum "Apps4Av Forum") 
so that everyone can benefit from awareness of the problem and
solutions._

[**Avare**](/overview.html "Avare") provides GPS active location on
all FAA charts, Airport Diagrams and Approach Plates; along with CS
(AF/D), weather & TFRs, Flight Plans and much more. Internet is only
required for installing or updating the free app and free FAA
resources - ground planning and in-flight operations work fine
offline, even in "Airplane Mode" for maximum battery life. GPS
(internal or external to the Android device) of course is required for
active location services.
