## Improve this website

If you are an Avare user and willing to **help improve Avare
documentation**, please join us in maintaining this website! Our
site's source is posted publicly on
[GitHub](https://github.com/avare-docs/avare-docs.github.io).

Instructions for preferred submission methodology are
[here](https://github.com/avare-docs/avare-docs.github.io).  However,
**please do not let process be a barrier to progress**.  If you want
to make a contribution at it is too technically challenging, please
just email a plain text markdown (or html) file.

Since all edits are reviewed by our core team before changes go live,
contributors don't need to worry about making mistakes. If you'd like
to just dive in and see how easy the process is, here are a few quick steps.
1. Open a new tab or window in your internet browser.
2. Sign up for a free [account](https://github.com/avare-docs.github.io) by bookmarking that link and then clicking "Sign up" at the top-right.
3. Use the above link to find and the item you'd like to edit in a new tab, keeping this one open for reference. A great first edit is this [edit.md](https://github.com/avare-docs/avare-docs.github.io/blob/main/edit.md) one you're reading, because you can help make editing easier for others to learn. Again, it's easy and error-proof.
4. After making your edit(s), scroll down to the box titled **Propose changes** and in the "Update..." box type in a short descriptive title, then in the "Add an optional extended..." box type in some details about your excellent edit.
5. When it's all looking ok, click the green "**Propose changes**" button.
6. After the system has checked it and found no technical errors, click the green "**Create Pull Request**" button. That simply sends it to one of our Apps4Av volunteers to double-check your helpful contribution and make it the latest public update, and making you a proud official Contributing Volunteer!
