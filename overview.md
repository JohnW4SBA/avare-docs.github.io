**Introduction** Avare (pronounced **ə-ˈver** - sounds like
"ah**v**air" - think "aware" with a V) is a free a**v**iation
situational awareness moving map aviation GPS app first developed in
Boston, and donated to aviators and open source programmers. There are
**no push ads**, no special permissions, and no hidden charges or
subscription fees.

"tabs" beyond 3D.\[/caption\]

Avare sometimes adds helpful new unannounced features, so please see our 
**[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ds.avare "Avare on Play Store")**
page for some of the latest and anytime you
Update the app. When new features are in development or announced,
you'll usually find discussion on our
**[Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apps4av-forum "Apps4Av Forum")**.
In the Avare app itself, be sure to also look up
new features via the **Help** button (tap **Map**, **Menu**, and
**Help**). We ask that you refrain from asking questions or sharing
negative feedback on app stores such as Google Play, because we don't
monitor those sites. Instead, please visit our
[Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apps4av-forum "Apps4Av Forum")
where you can read, search for answers, request features or
changes, and get prompt help with any problems you may encounter. You
can also visit our **[Avare YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0OSj8qmkSg01DIilEzxHGg)**
for basic introductory videos and a few tips, and share links on our
Forum for any videos you post or find helpful anywhere online.

**Basic features** in Avare include offline (after download) airport
quick reference including local sunrise/set, fuel availability, and
full FAA C.Supplement (A/FD) pages; active GPS location on all FAA VFR
Sectionals, WACs, TACs, IFR Plates and other charts including Airport
Diagrams, and an Open Street Maps depiction of each airport Area
including those not included in FAA materials. Avare enables manual
browsing of all charts and all other materials even with GPS turned
off (Simulation mode). Current FAA internet (and ADS-B In, with
receiver) weather METARs, NEXRAD, TAFs, TFRs, and Flight Plans are
supported too, along with a detailed Near list of airports, live 3D
terrain or chart view and other extras. Permissions required include
Internet access for downloading free current FAA materials and
information, Storage access for storing materials, Bluetooth for new
features like ADS-B, and GPS location to provide the moving map
feature.

<!--
In recent years we've added apps that may be useful for non-aviators,
so see the full Apps4Av (Apps For Aviators) list by clicking on the
**See More** button next to **More by Apps For Aviators** on Avare's
Google Play Store page or 
[**try this link**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/cluster?clp=igMxChkKEzUzNTcxMjAxNjkwMDg5MjU3MDAQCBgDEhIKDGNvbS5kcy5hdmFyZRABGAMYAQ%3D%3D:S:ANO1ljI_-70&gsr=CjSKAzEKGQoTNTM1NzEyMDE2OTAwODkyNTcwMBAIGAMSEgoMY29tLmRzLmF2YXJlEAEYAxgB:S:ANO1ljLM5Bk "Apps4Av on Google Play")
(working as of Dec.2019). There you'll also find some older free open
source **[AddOn Apps](https://apps4av.net/site/avare-overview/avare-%e2%80%a2-addon-apps/ "Avare • AddOn Apps")**
that we created in the past to complement and extend the capabilities
of Avare. Although many of their features are now included and
sometimes enhanced within recent Avare versions, some of those apps
are still be helpful for a few aviators. As with Avare, all our apps
are free and open source, with no annoying push ads or invasive
Permissions. **Notice:** Avare is not an FAA certified GPS. Be aware
that Avare is in the same category as **all** apps for portable
devices like tablets and phones of any brand. [See our FAQ](faq.html)
for more details and links to some relevant FAA
documents.

If you're a pilot (or passenger) who ever wished for a free collection
of current FAA materials and information on your phone or other
Android device in flight, right now is the time to install Avare. To
visit the **Google Play store page for Avare** where you can read
Reviews and Install Avare, just **[Click here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ds.avare "Avare page on Google Play Store")**
with your Android device.

**Popular Features Include** Online or offline moving map FAA charts
with or without GPS, download only the charts you need; ground track &
destination bearing, GPS speed & altitude, distance, user waypoints,
destination & track indicators; track lines, rubber banding, and
recordings; ETA, CSup (A/FD), Airport Diagrams; and bearing & distance
to/from any point on the chart. Display options include Landscape and
Portrait mode, plus North Up or limited Track Up (text on the free FAA
charts rotates with the chart in Track Up mode). All the Avare apps
and all features are free.

Avare works on most Android devices (note: devices without GPS or
other hardware may be rejected by Google Play's Install, though we
offer a [manual installation](/manual-installation.html "Manual Install")
option for such devices). Some devices will work even better with an
inexpensive external WAAS GPS, and works with most ADS-B receivers
including the powerful inexpensive Stratu**X** (see our Forum
about Stratu**S** brand limitations). Avare works on even many small
or older Android devices although of course best results and some
features like the "PFD" benefit from newer devices, and an inexpensive
external Bluetooth GPS may improve reliability and accuracy. Some
users prefer the larger screen area on a tablet device. The fact that
Avare was designed for and runs fine on a minimal early Android device
means that on newer devices it's even more responsive and easier to
use, and with a 4" or larger screen it's _much_ easier to use and read
in flight than a paper chart or similar size FAA certified panel
GPS. Avare is for Android only so some iOS users have bought an
inexpensive or used Android phone or tablet just to use Avare.

For more details about Avare, please see the
[Help](/help.html "Help") page on this website or just install the latest version and
discover for yourself how useful Avare is. To visit the **Google Play
store page for Avare** where you can read Reviews and Install Avare,

We sincerely welcome feedback on all aspects of our products so please
consider joining our
[Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apps4av-forum "Avare Forum")
to share your questions, feedback, feature requests, or how
you use Avare. On the Forum you'll also find the very latest on new
and planned features. You can also check the Play Store for the latest
updates, and check (or sign up to Follow) the 
"[Newest Here](https://apps4av.net/site/news/ "News")" section on this
introductory website to see our infrequent announcements of some new
features or related aviation developments that might not be announced
on our Forum.

**Other Install Options** For a time we tried to offer Avare on the
**Amazon** Android store, but after extensive problems with them
(including them deleting Avare without notice), we have stopped
trying. We do want to help users of all Android devices including the
Kindle to get Avare working on their devices. If you can't install on
Google Play, please try the method outlined on our 
[**manual installation page**](/manual-installation.html "Manual Install").
Please take a moment to search on our
[Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apps4av-forum "Avare Forum") 
in case anyone else has done it and to let everyone know,
regardless of whether or not you're able to use the Manual
Installation on your particular device. By installing Avare or any of
our apps, you're invited to consider yourself part of our
team. \***Note** that although we endeavor to ensure the integrity of
our Manual Install versions of Avare, the Google Play Store or another
source you completely trust may be safer if you can get them to work
on your device.

**Join** If you like Avare and find it useful, we invite you to join
the aviators supporting our free apps.

you'll join us in encouraging pilots to try them out. All feedback
allows us to gauge features of most interest, and to learn of and fix
any problems.
