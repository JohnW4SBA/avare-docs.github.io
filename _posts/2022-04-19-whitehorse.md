The FAA discontinued the Whitehorse sectional as of February 25, 2021.
This was highlighted on the Avare mailing list
[here](https://groups.google.com/g/apps4av-forum/c/UBTvUXVpKCU).

## What happened?

*   The Whitehorse sectional is gone.  The small part of the sectional
	that is US airspace (the Seward and Hubbard Glacier region) was
	included as an inset in Juneau ![Whitehorse inset in
	Juneau](/images/WhiteHorse-Inset.webp).

*  That Seward and Hubbard Glacier inset has been geotagged and
   incorporated into the Avare national map (as seen in the
   approximate center of this image) ![Whitehorse inset in
   Juneau](/images/WhiteHorse-inplace.webp).

## How does this impact Avare users?

If you previously used the Whitehorse sectional, the last issuance of
the Whitehorse sectional had been retained in Avare (though it was
overlayed by the inset in that region) during a transition
period. That transition period ended with the cycle known as 2204
(April 21st, 2022). **The last issuance of Whitehorse is no longer
distributed.**

The Seward and Hubbard Glacier inset is now included in the Juneau
sectional download.

## Summary and required action

### Minimum action to have up-to-date charts in this region

In summary, to prevent download failures and ensure you have the
Seward and Hubbard Glacier regional inset:

-   Delete Whitehorse from your sectional downloads
-   Optionally, download the Juneau sectional to get the inset

### Action for complete removal of all traces of Whitehorse

Depending on when you first downloaded Avare and its databases, the
above operation may leave one or more stray files on your device
(leftover from the Whitehorse sectional). **These are not easily
deleted.**

The following is an example of what may happen:

In this example image, a file that was previously a part of the
databases (when Whitehorse section existed) remains and appears as a
sliver of the old sectional. **There is no in-app way to remove it.**
The easiest way to remove this cruft is to clear the Avare storage and
cache (under app-settings).  Alternatively, uninstall and reinstall
the app. In either case, **your settings and downloads will be lost**.
