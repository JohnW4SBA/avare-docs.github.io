**Introduction** In-Flight Instruments (I-FI) is a small Android
application for aviators. I-FI is provided free, with no ads or
Permissions. It was developed as a personal project to experiment with
the Android platform and devices. Note that it requires an internal
solid-state gyroscope in the Android device for full
functionality. _**Warning:**_ **This app should never be used as a
primary source of aviation or navigation information in flight.**

**Features** Attitude Indicator (AI) and a Heading Indicator similar
to a Directional Gyro (DG) for devices like the Nexus-7 equipped with
internal Gyroscopes.

**On devices where an internal solid-state gyroscope is absent, there
may be abrupt changes to attitude and heading.** Even on those
devices, some pilots report that the Heading Indicator might sometimes
be off by up to 30 degrees, though the AI functioned perfectly and the
"DG" would occasionally reset to then show an accurate heading.

For those devices without an internal solid-state gyro this app uses
the internal accelerometer and magnetic flux of the earth to calculate
the orientation of the device relative to gravity. This interpreted
orientation is then converted to pitch, yaw, and roll by calculations
in the app for display on the screen. Some pilots whose Android
devices don't have an internal gyro (the Droid X for example) report
that I-FI still displays a useful backup AI.
