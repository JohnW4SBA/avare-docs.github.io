Avare has improved and changed often but this _**Introductory**_
website is updated infrequently so please also visit our 
[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ds.avare "Avare on Play Store") or
[Forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/apps4av-forum "Apps4Av Forum") for the latest. Our 
[YouTube Apps4Av Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0OSj8qmkSg01DIilEzxHGg) is
also updated infrequently but may be helpful in getting acquainted
with Avare installation and basics or learning a few tricks, and if
you Subscribe you'll be notified anytime something new does appear
there. To explore all of the very latest screens and features, we
invite you to just install the free open source app and a small
selection of the free FAA materials formatted to work with it.

Here are some sample screens to give you a quick sense of some Avare
capabilities and the overall interface. The screens capturedÂ most
recently are on top, with some older screens below. Again, this site
is infrequently updated, so even the most recent screens here are
likely to not be the latest version, or to show the latest features
and interface.

**Screen Sample From A Much Older Avare Version**

This screen capture was done March 28, 2014 on a Nexus 7 tablet
showing Nexrad radar on Avare 5.4.5 in Landscape mode zoomed out to
show precip with GPS acquired, AEX as destination, and the device
stationary on the ground. Note that some of the Dynamic Fields (across
the top) have been changed from defaults by the user (double-tap),
with "background" (gray bar) on.

This screen capture was done October 1, 2013 on a Nexus 7 tablet in
Portrait mode showing an Active Plan from IZA to O52 via SMF to avoid
TFRs. Chart Type is set to WAC and zoomed out to show a large portion
of the route.
