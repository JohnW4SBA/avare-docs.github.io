To help in choosing charts with the Download function in Avare, here
are the FAA Chart Maps showing the coverage area of each chart for
Sectionals and WACs. Note that TAC coverage areas named for the Class
B cities they cover, are shown in purple on the Sectional index
maps. You may want to download all of theseÂ FAA Chart Maps so you can
view them offline on your Android device using an image viewer app
such as Gallery.

Above is an Index map of continental U.S. Sectional charts. Because
the version of this map on the FAA website is very difficult to read,
we've scanned it from the cover of the paper 28 JUN 2012 LA Sectional
chart.

Below is an Index map of continental U.S. WAC charts, from the FAA
website. _**Notes:**_ WAC charts cover large areas of Canada, Mexico
and the Caribbean. In the WAC list of Avare's Download screen we have
added the two-letter state codes for the largest portion of each
U.S. state that's covered in that FAA WAC. For example: `CF-16
(WA,OR,ID,MT)` As you can see in the FAA Chart Map below, CF-16 covers
only the western (largest) portion of MT. When choosing WACs for
download, we suggest you consult the FAA Chart Map to find the exact
WAC area you want.
