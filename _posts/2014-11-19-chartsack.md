Chart Sack lets you navigate on any chart of your choice. You can
download a topographic map from the Internet, scan a paper map, or
even draw one yourself. The only requirements for the charts are that
they are to scale, and are in a JPEG, BMP, GIF, or PNG file format.

## Quick Start

The video **[here](http://youtu.be/49faROnmkhk)** shows how to tag,
and then navigate on a chart.

1.   You must be connected to Internet to tag a chart, but once it is
     tagged, you can navigate on it without a need for Internet
     connection.
1.   Place the chart you want to navigate on in the Download folder of
     your device (phone, tablet). The easiest way is to just download
     a map from the Internet using the browser.
1.   In the app's top left menu, select "Load Chart", then click on
     "Browse" to locate the chart, then click on it to load it.
1.   When the chart is loaded, it is ready to view in the "Navigate"
     screen in the app's top left menu. If the chart is visible, you
     can start the tagging process to navigate on it.
1.   In the app's top left menu, select "Tag Chart".
1.   Move the centre of the red cross hair on top of a well known
     point, then press the tag button in the bottom right. Type the
     name of the point, then select one of the presented options that
     accurately represents that point.
1.   Repeat the process in the above step to tag one more point,
     diagonally well away from the first point.
1.   In the app's top left menu, select "Navigate", then press the
     "Find" button in the bottom right, then enter and select a point
     on the chart. If the red cross hair appears correctly on that
     point, you have correctly tagged the chart, and it is ready for
     navigation
1.   If the chart is not correctly tagged, repeat the tagging process,
     as described above.

## Tips

-    When selecting a point during tagging, make sure that point is
     well defined. A well defined point can be a geological feature
     like "Old Faithful", or "Mount Washington".
-    If you know the latitude and longitude of the point being tagged,
     you can simply enter it as latitude,longitude (example
     42.4222,-72.443).
-    When the GPS is locked, and the chart is correctly tagged,
     pressing the middle Home button in the "Navigate" screen will
     place your current position under the cross hair centre.
-    All the points that you find and select will be automatically
     stored in the app for future use. These points will be available
     regardless of Internet connectivity.
-    Charts used must be to-scale and should use WGS84 projection.
