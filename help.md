For a written introduction to launching Avare (pronounced **ə-ˈver** – sounds like “ah**v**air” – think “aware” with a V), please _**begin with the Help feature included in the Avare app**_ (tap the Map tab, then the Menu button above it). If a picture is worth 1,000 words a video might be even better, so many users prefer our Apps4Av [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0OSj8qmkSg01DIilEzxHGg "Avare YouTube Channel").  If you like to save time by skimming a summary of the most common questions people have about Avare, check out our [**FAQ**](https://apps4av.net/site/avare-overview/avare-%e2%80%a2-faq/ "Avare • FAQ") page. For more Help and info on the latest features, or to help us and other users by sharing your tips and tricks or questions and requests please visit our [Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apps4av-forum "Apps4Av Forum"). **Note** that all of our apps have been thoroughly tested and are used routinely on a vast array of devices, so if you should encounter any problems please read Help and see the Troubleshooting section on this page and then contact us on our [Forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/apps4av-forum "Apps4Av Forum") so that everyone can benefit from your experience.

## Notes

- Be sure you have Registered your copy of Avare, and agreed to the required Permissions. If you get an error during the Downloads, your Permissions may not all be allowed for Avare to access your device. If in doubt, open the Settings on your Device and select the Apps or Applications section, find and tap on the Avare app line, tap the Permissions line, and make sure none are turned off.
- **No charts or airport data can be displayed until you have used the Download feature** (data connection required) to retrieve the Databases and the other free materials you will be using. Choosing **only** what you need saves you time and allows us to keep Avare free by reducing the load on our servers. To begin, press the Map tab, then the Menu, then press Download and select any materials you want from each category. Tap the Get button to begin installing your selected materials. Later you can just tap the Update button to refresh all your selected charts and materials.

### Troubleshooting

Among the few problems reported with Avare or any of our apps, in addition to the two items noted above, three main categories have emerged:

1. _Incomplete installation_. Most of these problems have been related
	to internet connectivity problems during installation of the app,
	such as during download of the Database or charts for Avare. If
	you have problems with any of our apps, you might first try
	checking your internet connection and then deleting and
	re-installing the file(s) or the app itself.
1. _Hardware problems_. Nearly all of these few cases have been traced
	to defective SD card chips. These problems can be very difficult
	to trace because they may occur randomly, intermittently, and with
	very strange symptoms. If you encounter problems, one thing to try
	is testing, formatting, or replacing the memory chip if
	possible. Sometimes deleting and re-installing the app and all
	associated files will cure or change the problem at least
	temporarily if it shifts the location where the app and files are
	stored on the chip. You might be able to work around the problem
	by moving the app and files to a different chip (e.g. from device
	memory to SD card or vice versa). Note that Android's support of
	SD cards varies with each Android version and device, so you may
	want to avoid SD and simply keep Avare and all its files in the
	main device memory. Generally the permanent solution for a
	defective memory chip is to replace the chip.
1. _Software conflicts._ Another category of weird and intermittent
   problems arises from conflicts with other apps. Unlike nearly all
   apps currently available for Android, our apps strictly follow
   Android developer guidelines and use only the bare minimum of
   Permissions required for operation. Apps you have installed from
   other developers may use Permissions that enable them to
   automatically launch their app, keep it active, display ads,
   collect and use your personal information or do other operations in
   the background even when you're not using their app. Such activity
   by those apps can cause strange and intermittent problems with
   other apps. _Usually_, the apps that come pre-installed on your
   device won't cause such problems. Something to try if you have
   problems with any of our apps is to close all other apps with
   Android's Task Manager, or disable (or even uninstall) other apps
   (Android Settings/Apps) on your device. You might also try a virus
   scanner from a reputable provider, keeping in mind that some
   anti-virus apps from disreputable providers have themselves been
   used to install a virus.

**Avare Quick Intro** _**NOTE**_: Because of continuing and sometimes
rapid development and changes in Avare, parts of the following intro
**may be outdated** so always use Avare's in-app Help function and our
[Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apps4av-forum) for the latest info.

•**Text information** is displayed around the margins of the "Map" display screen.

When your GPS position is acquired and you have input a valid
Destination this text can provide information including: your GPS
ground speed; Distance and estimated Time from current GPS location to
Destination at current GPS ground speed and heading; GPS bearing to
Destination; GPS altitude; and GPS Heading of your current ground
track.

\[caption id="attachment\_69709" align="aligncenter" width="640"\][![Avare v7.6.8 2017](images/avare768onsmt3502.jpg)](images/2017/05/avare768onsmt3502.jpg) Map view before flight w/Draw note on R.Traffic flag for IZA (v7.6.8 on SM-T350)\[/caption\]

•A solid line indicates the direct **Track To Destination** from your
current GPS location when a Destination is selected. A dashed black
and white line indicates the current GPS direct heading to your
selected Destination. A red dashed line indicates your current GPS
ground track.

In flight the "aircraft" Location icon orientation and red dashed line
will indicate the current GPS heading. A solid line indicates the
direct track to the Destination from your location at the time when
the Destination was selected. To update the track line from a new
location, simply re-select the Destination using the Find tab.

•To get the **Distance to and from** any point from your current
location, long-press any point on the chart with GPS acquired. There
is a scrollable list with much more information provided too,
depending upon the Map point you choose to long-press and what weather
and other info you've downloaded before flight or acquired with ADS-B
In.

_**NOTE:**_  On small screens the Menu bar across the bottom **may not
show all the tabs** available, especially when Avare is set to
Portrait mode. Just drag the bar sideways and you'll see any extra
available buttons. A thin scroll bar below the tabs, will indicate
what portion of the tab bar you are viewing. The items displayed at
the top can be changed by double-tapping on any item or empty space in
the top bar **if** Dynamic Fields are enabled in Preferences.

•**TFRs** can be downloaded from the internet or acquired from an
external ADS-B In receiver and automatically displayed on the Map view
in Avare. Press the Menu button, the Download button in the list that
pops out, and then the Databases button. Tap the TFRs line to select
it so Avare can Get and display all current TFRs from the FAA (note
that you'll need to Get them again any time you'd like to get the
latest, but once fetched they will still be displayed for the period
of time set in Preferences even with your device offline). **Weather**
text can also be fetched and displayed in a similar manner. Graphical
and text ADS-B traffic and weather can also be added if you have a
compatible receiver.

_To view an HTML (web page code format) file of the current "offline"
Help file built into Avare, visit 
**[this source document page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apps4av/avare/master/app/src/main/assets/help.html "Current Avare internal Help File on GitHub website")**.
The most convenient way to view the file is to copy the entire page,
and paste it into a text document (use a plain text editor like
Notepad or TextEdit, or use "SaveAs Text" in a word processor). If you
name that file with a .html extension (e.g. AvareHelp.html), it will
open in any web browser on any computer or Android device so that you
can conveniently read it offline or print it. Note that this source
document is the actual Help page built into Avare, so the easiest way
to view it on any Android device is usually to simply use the Help
feature in Avare.

To download a printable PDF version of an old "offline" Help file
(about 3MB) that was created 2/20/2016 as described above from version
