The Apps4Av **Dev**eloper **Team** is an open, friendly, welcoming and
most of all **Fun** group of aviators who want to share our enjoyment
of flight and coding as an opportunity to improve ourselves
technically and socially. As such, the **Dev Team** has no "boss" and
no "rules" but instead have developed and continue to evolve this set
of Guidelines to help new contributors get comfortable quickly.

## **Dev Team Guidelines**

### **Personal:**

-   Do only what you want, when you want.
-   Enjoy your involvement or revise it until it's fun again.
-   Invest some effort in getting along with the core team.

### **Team:**

-   Help to welcome new contributors.
-   Encourage coding,Â financial, and infrastructure contributions.
-   Foster good "word of mouth" about our projects.
-   Utilize free means of promoting our projects.
