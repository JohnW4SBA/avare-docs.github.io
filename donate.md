# Why donate?

While the Avare app and our other Apps4Av efforts are all provided
free and without ads by our all-volunteer group, we do have
expenses. To help with that, some users of our apps have stepped up to
help by donating to the U.S. non-profit corporation we
established. For more information, please consult the **FAQ** below.

_We appreciate your interest and support._

- **How can I make a donation?** If you're ready to donate, please use one
	of the two **_Paypal_** secure **Donate** buttons built right into the
	Avare app (or above!) Just ensure that your Avare device is
	online, launch Avare, tap the **Map** tab, then the **Menu** button,
	then the **Help** button. The two donate buttons are at the bottom
	of that screen. All major credit cards are accepted.

- **How are the two secure Donate buttons built into the Avare app
	different?** If you select a simple **One Time Donation** you can
	optionally donate again for any amount at any time. If you
	choose an ongoing **Periodic Donation** (Subscription), it saves
	you the small effort of repeating the One Time Donation
	process, helps us to plan our budget expenditures based on
	income, and still allows you to easily cancel or change the
	Subscription at any time.

- **How is my donation used?** Your donation is applied toward Avare's
	continued improvement, and toward expenses. None of the Apps
	For Aviators volunteers receives any financial compensation
	from donations, and some of us have even donated both our time
	and money.

- **What are the main expenses my donation helps with?** As of December
	2020, donations are now mostly used to pay for server space,
	bandwidth, and occasional hardware for testing.Â  We've found
	that server fees have increased over time despite reductions
	in ISP service provision costs. In recent years there are
	fewer competitors in that market, and they understandably
	focus on profit.

- **Why does a Software-only application need money for improvement?** FAA
	charts, databases, and plates must be pre-processed from large
	files into Avare's much smaller files that can be easily
	downloaded and displayed on any Android device. In addition to
	covering our expenses your donation will help buy ADS-B
	receivers and other new equipment to enable expanding Avare
	compatibility with a variety of add-on devices. Where possible
	we welcome temporary loans of equipment, so that we can add
	them to the list supported by Avare and credit the company on
	our Partners list.

- **Are there any hidden costs to the application?** No. The application
	is totally free. However, we may eventually be forced to pass
	along any fees the FAA might decide to start charging everyone
	for FAA charts and other materials that are currently paid for
	by fuel taxes and other FAA revenue.

- **Why does Apps4Av provide the application free?** Apps For Aviators is
	run by volunteers who like to fly and to write software
	code. We have chosen to donate it as [Free Open Source Software
	(FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "FOSS Wiki").  The coding allows us to improve our programming
	skills, while making friends in the aviation and software
	communities. We like to hear your stories and ideas, and to
	see your aircraft. By providing the application for free, we
	are joined by more volunteers, meet more people, learn more,
	and reduce everyone's cost of flying safely. Publicly
	publishing our code also helps to protect all of us from
	hidden functions, spyware, or bugs that have been included in
	some proprietary apps.

- **What happens if I do not donate?** The application, charts and other
	materials will probably continue to be provided free because
	other people will continue donating their time and money. Many
	pilots have been willing to share with all of us some of the
	money Avare saves them, and some pilots have even donated much
	larger amounts to help us and the entire aviation community.

- **What happens if no one makes a donation?** We have been very pleased
	by all the support and encouragement of the aviation and
	software communities. If all donations were to stop, the
	Apps4Av team would probably continue donating our own time and
	funds to keep the project going for at least a little while
	and might eventually find other exciting things to do. New
	features would no longer be added, and at some point Avare
	might then no longer be compatible with the latest devices.

_Thanks for your interest in Avare and our all-volunteer team._
